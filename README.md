# 🎵 Spotify Song Recommendation System

## Brief Project Description

This project aims to build a music recommendation system that suggests songs similar to a user’s input based on audio characteristics such as tempo, energy, and danceability. The system will use machine learning techniques to identify similarity between songs and provide recommendations through an interactive web interface.

## The *Problem* behind the Project

With millions of songs available across platforms, users often struggle to discover music that matches their preferences or mood. Traditional browsing methods rely heavily on manual searching or popularity-based suggestions. This project aims to solve that problem by creating a content-based recommendation system that identifies songs with similar audio features and provides personalized suggestions automatically.

---

## Challenges

Some challenges involved in this project include:

- Handling a large dataset (600k+ songs)
- Cleaning and preprocessing real-world music data
- Selecting meaningful audio features for similarity computation
- Designing an efficient recommendation algorithm
- Integrating machine learning models with a web application
- Ensuring fast response time for recommendations

---

## Expectations

By the end of this project, we expect to deliver:

- A functional content-based music recommendation system
- A trained machine learning model capable of suggesting similar songs
- A user-friendly web interface for interaction
- A complete end-to-end data science project suitable for portfolios
- Practical experience in teamwork, GitHub collaboration, and deployment

## Tools & Technologies

The project will primarily use the following tools and technologies:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Plotly
- Streamlit
- Git & GitHub
