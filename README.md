# Spotify Song Recommendation System

---

## Brief project description

We are building a music recommendation system using a large Spotify dataset (600k+ songs).
Given a song, the system suggests 10 similar tracks based on audio characteristics like tempo, energy, and danceability, delivered through a simple web app.

## The *Problem* behind the project

People often struggle to find songs matching a specific mood, and most recommendation systems are opaque.
We aim to build a transparent content-based system that recommends songs using measurable audio features.

---

## Challenges

* Handling a large real-world dataset (600k+ tracks)
* Missing and inconsistent metadata
* Feature scaling for similarity calculations
* Choosing appropriate similarity metrics
* Maintaining fast response time

---

## Expectations

* Functional recommendation engine
* Streamlit web application
* 10 similar song recommendations per input
* Portfolio-ready project with live demo

---

## Tools & Technologies

`Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Cosine Similarity`, `KNN`, `Matplotlib/Plotly`, `Streamlit`, `GitHub`

## Results

(To be added at the end of the semester)
